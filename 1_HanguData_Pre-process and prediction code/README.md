## The Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning and Service Time Prediction 
* We use this data in  [Feng et al. (2023)](#1)  to showcase a data-driven decision support system for outpatient appointment scheduling with heterogeneous service time, and the details can be found in [Feng et al. (2024)](#2). The preprocessing script for the machine learning is also included in this repository.
* When training the service time prediction model, due to hardware limitations of our computer, we chose the more suitable Colab platform (link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hl1bdFYi3ImdHvrDOI9VM3c8uoxmH5xD?usp=drive_link) to run the DNNR model, while the XGBOOST, SVR, and LR models were run locally on the Jupyter notebook. For specific scripts, please refer to DNNR_colab.ipynb and XGB_SVR_LR.ipynb.
