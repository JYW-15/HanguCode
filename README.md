## The code used in  [Feng et al. (2024)](#2)
* We use this data in  [Feng et al. (2023)](#1)  to showcase a data-driven decision support system for outpatient appointment scheduling with heterogeneous service time, and the details can be found in [Feng et al. (2024)](#2). The preprocessing script for the machine learning and scheduling simulation are also included in this repository.

  With these codes, readers can repeat the results in [Feng et al. (2024)](#2). We recommend readers follow the steps below to execute the relevant scripts.

* 1_HanguData_Pre-process and prediction code

* 2_HanguData_Clustering and classification code

* 3_HanguData_Schedule simulation code

To facilitate readers in reproducing the results of the paper, we have provided the original dataset[[1]](#1) and the data generated during the experiment in the folders "1_HanguData_Pre-process and prediction code" and "Generated Data", respectively. If readers wish to use or refer to our code, please follow the citation format below.
